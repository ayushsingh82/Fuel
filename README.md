## Overview

Welcome to our DApp (Decentralized Application) built on the Fuel Network. This README provides an overview of our project, its features, and how to use it.

## Project Description

Our DApp utilizes the Fuel Network to create a decentralized platform for buying, selling, and listing properties as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). We have developed our own smart contract with features similar to a swapping mechanism, enhanced with NFT properties.

## Features



### 1. NFT Properties

- Properties are represented as NFTs, ensuring unique ownership and characteristics for each property token.
- Users can buy, sell, or list their properties as NFTs on our platform.

### 2. Property Listing

- Users have the option to list their properties on the platform.
- Listed properties are displayed as NFTs, allowing other users to browse and purchase them.

## How to Use

To interact with our DApp, follow these steps:

1. **Accessing the DApp**: Visit our DApp website or interface.
2. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your preferred wallet compatible with the Fuel Network.
3. **Explore Properties**: Browse through the listed properties or search for specific ones.
4. **Buying Properties**: If you find a property you wish to purchase, initiate the buying process through your connected wallet.
5. **Selling Properties**: If you own properties and wish to sell them, list them on the platform and wait for potential buyers.


## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contract**: Developed using Sway for the Fuel Network.
- **Frontend Interface**: Build with react , tailwind

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the user interface and experience for smoother navigation.
- **Integration with Other Networks**: Explore integration with other blockchain networks to expand the reach of our DApp.
- **Advanced Property Features**: Implement additional features for properties, such as detailed descriptions, multimedia content, etc.
- **Community Feedback Integration**: Gather feedback from users to prioritize feature enhancements and bug fixes.
